4. Scalable infrastructure for future growth

This design document serves as the foundation for implementation, with the understanding that iterative improvements will be made based on user feedback and market conditions. 



I had an idea of create a professional AI tool for crypto trader, like cursor for software engineer.  @design.md  is my initial design of this idea.  I'd like to create a product UI proto type for it.  I think it should include main, market, trade and config tab. each tab should has a wroksapce panel and a conversation panel.
