# PurrFectAiApp UI Prototype

This is a UI prototype for PurrFectAiApp, an autonomous trading AI agent system specialized for meme coin trading. The prototype demonstrates the user interface for the application, which includes four main tabs: Main, Market, Trade, and Config.

## Overview

PurrFectAiApp is designed to leverage real-time market data, social signals, and on-chain analytics to execute trades on behalf of users while generating revenue through exchange rebates. The UI prototype showcases the conversational interface that allows users to interact with the AI assistant.

## Prototype Structure

The prototype consists of four HTML files, each representing a different tab in the application:

1. **index.html** - Main Dashboard
   - Portfolio summary
   - Active positions
   - Recent trading signals

2. **market.html** - Market Analysis
   - Market overview and statistics
   - Top movers (gainers and losers)
   - Social media trends

3. **trade.html** - Trading Interface
   - Trading pair selection
   - Price chart
   - Order form with risk management controls

4. **config.html** - Configuration
   - Risk management settings
   - Default trade parameters
   - AI trading behavior settings

## Key Features Demonstrated

- **Dual-Panel Interface**: Each tab features a workspace panel (2/3 width) and a conversation panel (1/3 width)
- **Conversational AI**: The conversation panel shows how users can interact with the AI assistant using natural language
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is built with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern look
- **Trading Controls**: Interactive elements for placing trades and managing risk
- **Configuration Options**: Detailed settings that allow users to customize the AI's trading behavior

## How to View the Prototype

## Next Steps

This prototype represents the visual design and user experience of the PurrFectAiApp. The next steps would involve:

1. Implementing the backend functionality
2. Connecting to cryptocurrency exchanges via APIs
3. Developing the AI trading engine
4. Building the data collection and analysis pipeline

## Based On
